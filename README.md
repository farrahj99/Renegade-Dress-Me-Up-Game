When I first thought of my JavaScript project, I really didn't know what would 
have caught my interest. There were suggestions of card games, snake games but I 
felt like creating something related to fashion so I made a dress up game where you
could drag and drop the clothing pieces onto the characters.

I utilized the inertia gesture through http://interactjs.io/ to drag and drop the clothing pieces
onto the characters. This was causing an issue as the images are bouncing around until I created
three wrap divs to help position each area to help control each function.

I want to expand more on my JavaScript project by correcting the on click methods where we pick the
tops or bottoms and expanding more on the illustrations by heading over to Photoshop or Illustrator.
